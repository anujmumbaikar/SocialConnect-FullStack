## MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines
I use MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines for better performance and scalability across user interactions (likes, saves, followers, etc.).

### Why?
Instead of storing likes directly inside the post document, which leads to array updates and performance issues, we moved such data into separate collections and join them efficiently using aggregation.

### For Example:
> "Instead of saving likes into the same posts table, even if a single person again dislikes, then the whole array sorting would be expensive."
> I apply this same strategy for:
> Followers / Following
> Comments
